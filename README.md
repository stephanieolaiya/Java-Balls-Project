# Java-Balls-Project
 
This is for the CSCI2340 Programming Assignment. 

## Current Implementation
Use your bouncing balls for data visualization. Associate each ball with some data that can change over time.  Use the visual properties of the ball (size, speed, color, etc.) to show that data.  The data here is processes in your machines (either your processes or all processes). 

 - Assignment implemented in Java using Java Swing and AWT. 
 - The balls are colored by process type: Usr, Application, System or Other.
 - The size of each ball corresponds to it's associated process' CPU Usage.
 - ProcessMonitor that obtains process information runs in a different thread than Swing EDT thread.
