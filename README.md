# Java-Balls-Project
 
This is for the CSCI2340 Programming Assignment. 

## Current Implementation
 Use your bouncing balls for data visualization.  Associate each ball with some data that can change over time.  Use the visual properties of the ball (size, speed, color, etc.) to show that data.  The data here is processes in your machines (either your processes or all processes). The balls are colored by process type: Usr, Application, System or Other. The size of each tball corresponds to CPU Usage of the process it is associated with
